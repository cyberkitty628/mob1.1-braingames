## Stroop Effect

By using a color matching activity, this game will be demonstrating the Stroop effect. In psychology, the Stroop effect describes the delay in reaction time between corresponding and contradictory stimuli. 
This happens when we experience difficulty naming a physical color when it is used to spell the name of a different color. With Brain Games, you'll train your mind to combat this phenomenon!
